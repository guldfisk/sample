Ok, was unsure whether or not I was supposed to retrieve the data from the sample endpoint every time, but since the service should edit and delete the data, I just have assumed i should retrieve the data from the endpoint on initilization and store it locally. This is done via the initializedb management command.

For testing I use a fixture generated by dumping the database genreated from the command, to avoid have to retrieve it every time.

For editing, deleting and updating products, I have just registrered it with django's built in management site.
